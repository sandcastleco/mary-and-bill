      <blockquote>“Witty & sweet... This earnest & amusing documentary conveys an invigorating message: it is never too late (or too early, as Andrew Napier began filming 'Mary & Bill' aged 16) to do what you want to do, to be inspired & to inspire others. Napier beautifully cuts the documentary to enhance how the older generation can still be exciting role models & he is certainly a talent to watch out for himself... 'Mary & Bill' is so incredibly uplifting you’ll need to be peeled off the ceiling after watching it.” ~ The Upcoming 06/28/13 Read the full review.</blockquote>

      <h2>About the Film</h2>
      <p>Mary Stroebe is a 90-year-old triathlete and breast cancer survivor. Bill Wambach is an 83-year-old high jump champion and pilot. Mary appeared on the 'Regis and Kelly' show and received a 'Relly award' after competing in their Super Senior Challange. Bill holds the national record in his age bracket for high jump and was named “Male Athlete of the Year” by the National Congress of State Games. This documentary follows both Mary and Bill immediately after they experience serious health related problems. Mary breaks her leg while downhill skiing, and Bill, who smoked for 45 years, is recovering from a heart attack. Despite these physical ailments, both decide to train for their respective events: Mary hopes to complete the Lifetime Fitness triathlon and Bill will attempt to win the National Senior Olympics. Through their amazing commitment, both Mary and Bill prove that age is just a number.</p>
