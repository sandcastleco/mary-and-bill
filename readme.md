## Technical notes

This site uses [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) for CSS. It might feel crazy at first. Give it a try if you haven't, and familiarize yourself a bit with the documentation on the Tachyons site to get a sense of how it works.

There's no build system, it's a plain HTML file and a little bit of CSS.

## Project management

Tasks left to do are organized in the Sandcastle Asana. Contact @kmcgillivray or @fosterstilp for access.

## Deployment

The site is hosted in GitHub Pagesâ€”the code pushed to the master branch is automatically deployed, so merge changes into master in order to make them live.
